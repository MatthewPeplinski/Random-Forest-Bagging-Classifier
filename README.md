# Random-Forest-Bagging-Classifier
Using Random Forest and Bagging Classifier to predict precipitation types based on several weather metrics.
This exercise also was used to show that effects of training and validating on the same dataset results in higher
prediction power on the test set but may lead to lower prediction power on new test data.
  Included are images of the resulting confusion matricies utilizing a train test split data vs training on the total data set.
  There is also a bar graph representing the level of feature importance to the model.
